# TorontoCrimePrediction
Using the K_Means algorithm, this model predicts where crime is most likely to occur in the city of Toronto.

```assault.csv``` contains the data used to train the model. This was gathered from [http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/](http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/)

```CrimePredGen.ipynb``` is an incomplete file that provides data/training visualization, model optimization, and a prediction generating function. Map rendering is still being developed.
